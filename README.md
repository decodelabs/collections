Wait, another collections library for PHP?
Yup.. there's plenty out there. This one is specifically for the sake of functionality over speed, and for use as foundation for more complex structures.

If you're after standard collections, you should check out the [PHP Ds extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.ds.php).
